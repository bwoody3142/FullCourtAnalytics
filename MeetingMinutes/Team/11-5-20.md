## Topics Discussed

- Firstly, we created the repository for our code on Github. 
- We had our mentor join the meeting to help us to get started on the project and where he thought we should begin on iteration 1. 
- We then began working on the project. We decided to have a couple people begin working on the views for the website and the rest of the group start working on the Youtube API.
- While working on the YouTube API, we found that we need permission to use it for commercial use, so we contacted our client about this issue. We are waiting to hear back. 

## Things Clarified

- We clarified with our mentor to meet Thursday the 12th for our Mid-Iteration meeting with our mentor. 
- We clarified our to-do items for iteration 1 with our mentor. He thouht we should work on some of the views and figuring out the Youtube API for the website to be able to upload 
game film and then be able to watch the game in the website. 
- We clarified our weekly meeting with our client will be on Tuesday, since we missed last weeks due to the election.
