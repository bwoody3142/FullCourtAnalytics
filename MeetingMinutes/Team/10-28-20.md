## Topics Discussed

We discussed design day presentations, One thing we talked about related to that was for the assignment due the first, the reviewing of other groups. 
The discussion of other projects was constructive because it helped us realize what we can fix when it comes to our own design, or even how we operate as a group/team.

## Things Clarified

We talked about the timeline for next week, including things such as learning and becoming familiar with the technologies within our tech stack, especially with react.
One discussion was the possibility of moving away from mySQL but the idea will have to run by our mentor Keith
