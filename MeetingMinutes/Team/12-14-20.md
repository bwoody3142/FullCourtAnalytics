## Topics Discussed

We discussed plans for the iteration and when we meet with our client for the presentation of iteration 2.
We discussed using our Sh*t happens clause for an extra couple days to work on the project because we weren't happy with where it was and when the deadline was.

## Things Clarified

We discussed the possibility of continuing to work through the break so that we can hopefully meet a deadline for the end of the 
5 iterations so we don't havew to cram every feature in the final weeks of the semester.
We also discussed what we were intending on talking about with keith in our meeting with him tomorrow or wednesday.
