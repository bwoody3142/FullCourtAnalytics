## Topics Discussed
- We discussed where we are on our project and merged some of the branches to the main branch to see what the website looks like with everything.
- We discussed the Dockerfile and created it. After that, we tested it through everyone's computer to make sure it works. 
- We discussed the documentation files and started to work on them. 
- We discussed that we should try to get the software for iteration 1 done by Friday night or Saturday afternoon, so we can put together the User manual for the project. 

## Things Clarified
- We clarified that we are going to meet tomorrow again to work on software and maybe start the documentation for the User manual.
- We clarified when we are going to wrap things up for iteration 1.
- We clarified that our Dockerfile is working correctly for easy replication.
