## Topics Discussed

- First, we had Keith clone the project and get it up and running on his computer. 
- He then used the website and gave us his feedback while he using it. 
- He didn't have much to critque, but he did point out that on the splash page he thought the blue text meant that it was a link, so he tried to click on it. 
- Other stuff he added was: there is no pricing info anywhere, the link that gets you to the single game stats is hard to see.
- He also didn't add a roster before uploading a game and going to the annotator page and there was no players.
- He liked the substitution feature, the splash page, and he liked the overall format of the website. 
- After, he helped us with a deployment issue we were having, so now the website can be accessed through a link. 

## Things Clarified

- We clarified what we need to change and modify after watching Keith use the website
- We clarified and fixed the deployment issues.
- We clarfied that we will have to meet with him at least a couple more times before the semester is over.
