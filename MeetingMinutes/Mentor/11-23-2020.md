## Topics Discussed

- We discussed the first iteration documentation, he thought everything looked good. 
- We showed him what our software looks like at this point after iteration 1. He thought we made good progress and know that we have a better understanding of the tech stack that 
we are using, we should be in good shape going into iteration 2. 
- We discussed our issues with testing in React with him, to see if he could help us through with testing issues. He was a big help in getting the test to run on our computer,
because we were somehow missing a configuration file for Jest to run. 
- We discussed our thoughts on what we should do for iteration 2. He agreed that we should try to get our database set up, so we can start implementing the back end of the software.
- We also asked him if he had any suggestions for video hosting. He said he would recommend MUX, but it does get expensive. 

## Things Clarified

- We clarified that the next iteration is going to be a short one and will have to meet with him soon for the mid-iteration meeting. 
- We clarified what our goals are going to be during iteration 2. 
- We have a better understanding of testing, but still having issues due to enzyme not being supported in React 17.
