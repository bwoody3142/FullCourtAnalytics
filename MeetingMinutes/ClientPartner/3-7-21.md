## Topics Discussed

- We discussed and walked Josh through getting the website up on his computer by having him clone our repo on github. 
- We had him use the website with little guidance and he found a few things that he wants changed, but nothing major. 
- He wants the Roster modal for adding a new player line up, instead of having 'Sign Out' on the teams home page, he wants an account button on the right and in that will have roster 
management, the button where you go to get individual game stats needs to be blue, add game review tab on the nav bar, when you hover over a tab on the splash page, he wants the text to be 
blue, and he wants the page to ease scroll when you click on one of the options on the nav bar. 
- He said that he really likes the flow of the website.
- He said that him and Bryce need to meet to work out some kinks in the Annotator page.
