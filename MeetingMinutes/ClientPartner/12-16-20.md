## Topics Discussed

- We discussed how the software looks for iteration 2. He was very pleased at what it looks like and he gave us a few suggestions on what he would like to see changed. 
- Some of the things that we need to change and add is how the play-by-play will look like and how the start and end possesion buttons will work. Another thing 
is to add a way to save the progress of the game and to be able to come back and annotate at a later time. 
- We talked about how the annotator page will have buttons with stats, but some of the stats will not be shown in the stats table. 
- We discussed the upcoming itertion and that we are going to work over break. We plan on figuring out the shot chart feature and to implement it. 
- We talked about how we want to make sure that Josh can get the software up and running on his computer to actually use it. 

## Things Clarified

- We clarified what we plan on working on the project over break to try to get more completed.
- We clarified that Josh will be available Monday-Friday after 5. 
- We clarified what we are going to try to get done for iteration 3, and also clarified that Josh is going to send us an email with more details of what we discussed and 
what changes he wants.
