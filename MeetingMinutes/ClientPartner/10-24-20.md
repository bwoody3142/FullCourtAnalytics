## Topics Discussed

We reviewed the design items for the project. We further discussed how a player would be able to use the service. We came up with that the decision for how much a player can view would be up to the 
coaches to decide. 

## Things Clarified

We clarified that it would be best to get server space for the website as soon as possible so it would be easier for us to test it out. We also clarified the player account and how much they would 
be able to see. We plan to have our weekly meeting following our design day presentation.
